# Trying out some stuff with TypeScript and Material UI

I've been playing around and trying out some things with both TypeScript and Material UI. 

I'm following general coding principles to the best of my knowledge and I'm also using this app as a way to also practice how to make an app responsive and keep components somewhat simple and tidy.

I've also added my signature ChubbyBot Logo in the header

## Requirements

To run the app, you need to run an `npm install` in the terminal and then run `npm start` to view the web page at localhost:3000/

## Installation

* Clone the project
* Select the right folder path
* Run `npm install` in the terminal
